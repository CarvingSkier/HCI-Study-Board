  "Activity Description": "Barbara is seated at her desk in a cozy office, reviewing her completed presentation on the computer. She then updates her time tracking sheet, focusing on entering data. After a moment of contemplation, she leans back in her chair, satisfied with her productivity.",
  "Smart Assistant Interaction A": "Hey Barbara! It sounds like you're getting into your admin routine. Just a quick heads-up: I'll hold off on any automated updates until you're done with your current steps. Once you’re ready, just let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like help with—like organizing your files or approving those expense reports. Let me know if you need a hand or just want some quiet time!",
  "Smart Assistant Interaction B": "Alright, let's get on top of those administrative tasks. How can I assist you with updating your time tracking sheet or organizing files today?"
