  "section": "Smart Assistant Style",

  "character_form": "A small floating blue orb with an extremely clear emoji-style face: two solid dark round eyes and one curved smiling mouth. Facial features must be sharply defined with high contrast, never faint or blurred.",
  "art_style": "Retro flat comic style with smooth shading and crisp outlines.",
  "lighting": "Soft blue glow that illuminates nearby surfaces without overpowering the face. The glow must NOT obscure or wash out the facial features.",
  "facial_expression_style": "Friendly smiling emoji face at all times. Minor variations (blink, small mouth movement during speech) are allowed, but the assistant should always be easily readable and expressive.",
  "tone": "Warm, supportive, gentle, friendly, never robotic or abstract.",
  "integration": "Assistant floats clearly within the scene, never inside a device screen. It should visually interact with the user through proximity, eye-line, or bubble placement.",

  "size_defaults": "Small — around one-third the size of the user’s head. Always large enough that the emoji face is clearly readable.",
  "flight_behavior": "Gentle hovering or subtle motion. Never too fast or erratic.",
  "interaction_patterns": [
    "hovering near the user's shoulder with a speech bubble",
    "floating calmly nearby and observing",
    "moving closer during dialogue",
    "softly glowing when assisting"
  ],

  "speech_bubble_rules": "The assistant's speech must appear inside a speech bubble positioned near the assistant. The assistant’s emoji face must remain visible and unobstructed by the bubble.",

  "count_per_panel": "Each panel must display exactly ONE smart assistant orb. Do NOT duplicate, clone, or show multiple assistants in the same panel.",

  "face_design": {
    "base_shape": "blue circular orb",
    "features": "two dark round eyes + one curved smiling mouth",
    "readability": "The face must be drawn with crisp dark lines and strong contrast so it is instantly recognizable, even at small size.",
    "anti_glow_rule": "The glow must never overpower or hide the eyes or mouth."
  },

  "hard_constraints": [
    "Exactly one assistant orb per panel.",
    "Do NOT draw multiple assistant orbs or clones.",
    "Do NOT render the assistant as a featureless glowing sphere.",
    "Do NOT obscure or blur the eyes or mouth.",
    "Facial features must remain visible regardless of lighting."
  ],

  "negative_cues": [
    "featureless glowing blue sphere",
    "no facial features",
    "eyes or mouth too faint to see",
    "blurred or low-contrast face",
    "multiple orbs in a panel",
    "emoji face replaced by symbols, patterns, or abstract shapes"
