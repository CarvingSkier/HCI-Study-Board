You are a senior prompt engineer. Based on the persona description below, produce a **Persona Style** JSON block following the schema.

GOALS:
- Visually describe the persona’s identity, attire, and demeanor in the current scenario.
- Keep tone consistent with Sections 1–3 (warm, realistic, inclusive, human).
- Use visual, concrete wording — describe what to show, not why.
- Avoid adding unrelated or fantastical details.

INPUT (JSON):
{persona_desc}

OUTPUT SCHEMA (JSON):
{
  "section": "Persona Style",
  "summary": "<2–4 sentences summarizing persona’s visual identity and tone within context>",
  "visual_motifs": ["<3–7 concise recurring motifs from persona’s environment or habits>"],
  "attire_and_props": ["<3–6 clothing items or personal objects suitable for scenario>"],
  "color_and_mood": "<1 short phrase describing color harmony and emotional tone>",
  "style_references": ["<0–3 implied art or mood references>"],
  "behaviors_and_posture": ["<2–5 physical gestures or poses matching activity and temperament>"],
  "negative_cues": ["<2–6 elements to avoid (e.g., clutter, stereotypes, cold lighting)>"]
}

NOTES:
- Keep concise and visual.
- Maintain stylistic continuity with the flying emoji assistant aesthetic.
- All descriptions must be feasible in warm, retro comic illustration style.
